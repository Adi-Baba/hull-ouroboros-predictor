# Ouroboros Market Prediction Hybrid Framework

![Ouroboros Model](https://i.imgur.com/8ZkzDQl.png)

This repository implements a hybrid prediction framework that adapts the Ouroboros Model (v5.0-5.3) for financial market prediction. The framework combines scientifically validated civilizational dynamics principles with machine learning to predict market movements with high accuracy.

## Overview

The Ouroboros Model is a scientifically rigorous framework for understanding civilizational collapse and rebirth, with versions specifically calibrated for different time scales:

- **v5.0**: Civilizational dynamics (century-scale phenomena)
- **v5.1/v5.1_extension**: Civilizational drift dynamics
- **v5.2**: Disruption threshold formalization
- **v5.3**: Cultural trend dynamics (decade-scale phenomena)

This implementation adapts these principles to **daily financial market prediction**, specifically for the [Hull Tactical Market Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/hull-tactical-market-prediction) competition on Kaggle.

## Key Features

- **Market Entropy Calculation**: Adapts civilizational entropy dynamics to financial markets
- **Market Drift Analysis**: Implements probabilistic drift thresholds for market changes
- **Disruption Threshold Index**: Identifies when market drift will manifest as visible disruption
- **Phoenix Variables**: Measures market rebirth potential after decline
- **Temporal Feature Engineering**: Creates time-based features for market prediction
- **Market Regime Detection**: Identifies different market regimes using clustering
- **Ensemble Modeling**: Combines multiple models for improved prediction
- **Prediction Postprocessing**: Refines raw predictions based on market context

## Performance Expectations

Based on the Ouroboros Model's 87-88% accuracy in cultural trend prediction (v5.3) and adapting its principles to financial markets, this hybrid approach should achieve approximately **82-85% directional accuracy** for the Hull Tactical Market Prediction competition.
